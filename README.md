# Rest API
### A simple yet effective Rest API written in Golang

## Description
The project is made entirely using *GO* & a 3rd party library called *gorilla mux*  
It's a rest API without the connection to any external database, involving actions on books data.

This project allows the user to make calls to the API and receive callbacks with the data.  
The API handles several http methods, such as:  
+ GET ( all the books / book by id )
+ POST
+ PUT
+ DELETE

## Summary
The project is a simple rest api involving books data and actions allowing to manipulate this data.  
There's no user authentication and no external database connected to it.  
Nevertheless, the api itself works perfectly fine without any issues and is ready to be further developed  
by connecting a database and adding other missing functionalities to it.
